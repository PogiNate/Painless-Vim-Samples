# Operator Practice!

## Single Character Changes

Remove a duplicated letter from the following words using the `d` command, or the `x` command.

- ddoctor
- appple
- awway

Use ~ and r on the sentence below:

"you can't grep a fred tree." --larry wall

Yank and put (`ylp`) a single letter to duplicate it. Let's pretend that this is faster than just typing the letter. It'll make more sense in a bit.

- mose
- gose
- mon

*Extra Credit:* Think of a word that has a duplicated letter *other* than "o". It's really hard! Okay, here's a couple:

- comitie
- Misisipi

## Line-wise changes:

Delete everything after the comma, then replace the comma with a period:
emacs is a great operating system, but it needs a good editor.

Duplicate the following line twice:

- Hip Hip, Hooray!

Put the following statements in order:

This far!
The line must be drawn here!
No further!
