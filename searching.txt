*******************
ATTENTION: The Illuminati have been doing terrible things to quotes of great works of literature! 
You need to find and destroy all instances of the word "fnord" in this document, 
except for that last one, you know, the one we just put in there to tell you what to destroy.
Don't destroy that one, because otherwise you won't know what to destroy.
Start by searching bacwards for the word...the word you're supposed to destroy... by typing "?" and then the word.
DO IT NOW!!!

Once you've cleaned out all the Illuminati influence above this secret message, you need to search BELOW this secret message. 
You can either type "/" and start a new search, or search BACKWARDS by typing "N".
The fate of this document is in your hands!

The "Old" vs "New Section!

This part of the document will have the word "old" in it a lot, so you can practice doing regular expression searches. Fun, huh?

Old ironsides, old iron, old sides.

Old people laugh more. Probably. 

Old friends are gold. YEP. GOLD. It's got the word OLD right in it, and you don't want it to be "GNEW", do you?
