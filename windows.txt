Let's play with windows!

First trick: create a new window by typing :sp now:

Okay, now put your cursor on line 4 and type something. You should see your text appear in both windows AT THE SAME TIME! It's like magic!

Now let's add a new VERTICAL split using the :vs command. You should have one big window and two little ones. Let's mess about a bit with one of the little ones.

Below is a professionally drawn box. Make one of the small windows exactly fit the box using:

<ctrl>+w + : Make a window taller
<ctrl>+w - : Make a window shorter
<ctrl>+w > : Make a window wider
<ctrl>+w < : make a window narrower.
