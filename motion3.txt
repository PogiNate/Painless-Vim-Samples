Now remove the entire URL above using a WORD command.

let's change Inner words now! Make the cow below say the right sound:

Oh the cow in the meadow goes "oink",
Oh the cow in the meadow goes "oink",
Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up
And that's how we get hamburgers!
                                --Phoebe Buffay

Now let's look at doing full text objects: replace the entire sentence below with something happier:

"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle" --Arthur Dent

Move forward 5 words in the following sentence, then back two. Why, you ask? More like "why not?"
