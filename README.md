# Painless Vim Samples

These are a bunch of sample documents for use with the book [Painless Vim]. 

## Installation

Either clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/PogiNate/Painless-Vim-Samples.git

Or just download the zip and extract it somewhere that's easy to get to. The book will tell you which sample to use, and the in-text examples will include line numbers so you can follow along at home.

If you have any questions feel free to submit an issue on this repository.
