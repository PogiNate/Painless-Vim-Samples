        Hi! I'm here to give you some things to edit! Autocompletion likes tags, so let's throw a few in here.:
        <ul>
            <li>New
            <li>text
            <li>is
            <li>awesome
            <li>right?
        </ul>
        <p>So, let's use some other completion aspects:</p>
